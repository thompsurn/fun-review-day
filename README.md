# JavaScript Fundamentals Review Day

This repository contains a series of challenges that concluded my JavaScript Fundamentals module during my Northcoders bootcamp. Each challenge is designed to reinforce key concepts and skills acquired throughout the course. I utilised Test Driven Development (TDD) to build robust functions, ensuring each piece of code meets specific requirements before implementation.

## Description

The challenges in this repository cover fundamental JavaScript concepts, including recursion, object manipulation, and asynchronous programming. Each challenge includes associated tests to verify the functionality of the implemented functions. One of the key functions developed is `deeplyEquals`, which checks for deep equality between objects and arrays.

## Installation

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/thompsurn/fun-review-day.git


Navigate into the project directory:

cd fun-review-day


You will need Node.js installed on your machine to run the project and tests.


# Usage

You can utilize the functions provided in this repository by importing them into your JavaScript files.


# Testing

To run the tests for this project, make sure you have Jest installed. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by running:

npm install --save-dev jest


Once Jest is installed, you can run the tests using the following command:

npm test


This will execute all the test cases defined in the repository, allowing you to verify that the functions behave as expected.
